## Project Title

Traffic Accident Analysis & Safety Hotspots

## Description

This project analyzes traffic accident data from major cities in Pakistan to identify accident patterns, high-risk areas, and contributing factors such as weather, road type, and vehicle involvement. The goal is to support data-driven road safety and traffic management decisions.

## Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Key Analysis

Accident frequency by city

Accident severity distribution

Peak accident hours

Impact of weather and road type

Casualties analysis

## Key Insights

1. Major urban cities experience higher accident frequency.

2. Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours.

3. Urban roads show a higher number of accidents than highways.

4. Weather conditions like fog and rain increase accident risk.

## Recommendations

1. Strengthen traffic monitoring during peak hours.

2. Improve road safety infrastructure in high-risk areas.
